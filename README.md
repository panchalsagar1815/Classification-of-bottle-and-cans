**Project Title: Classification of Cans and Bottles using Satellite Imagery**

**Overview:**
The "Classification of Cans and Bottles using Satellite Imagery" project focuses on leveraging advanced image processing and deep learning techniques to automatically identify and classify the presence of cans and bottles in satellite images. This application has significant implications for waste management, environmental monitoring, and sustainability efforts.

**Key Features:**

1. **Data Collection and Cleaning:**
   - Accumulated a diverse dataset comprising satellite images capturing different landscapes and terrains.
   - Implemented data cleaning techniques to remove artifacts, irrelevant features, and ensure uniformity in the dataset.
   - Ensured that the dataset was representative of various environmental conditions to enhance the model's robustness.

2. **Principal Component Analysis (PCA):**
   - Applied PCA to reduce the dimensionality of the satellite image data.
   - Extracted essential features to enhance model efficiency and reduce computational complexity.
   - Streamlined the dataset while retaining critical information for accurate classification.

3. **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN):**
   - Employed Convolutional Neural Networks, a deep learning architecture well-suited for image classification tasks.
   - Developed a CNN model using Keras, a high-level neural networks API, to facilitate efficient model construction and training.
   - Configured the model architecture to capture spatial hierarchies and intricate patterns within the satellite images.

4. **Train-Test Split and Model Compilation:**
   - Divided the dataset into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's generalization performance.
   - Utilized Keras to define, compile, and train the CNN model.
   - Configured the model with appropriate loss functions, optimizers, and evaluation metrics for effective training.

**Technologies Used:**
- Python for coding and scripting.
- Keras for building and training Convolutional Neural Networks.
- NumPy and Pandas for data manipulation and analysis.
- Scikit-learn for implementing PCA and train-test split.
- Satellite imagery processing libraries for handling remote sensing data.

**Expected Outcomes:**
- A trained model capable of accurately identifying and classifying cans and bottles in diverse satellite imagery.
- Evaluation metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score, to assess the model's performance.
- Practical applications in waste management, environmental monitoring, and large-scale automated analysis of satellite data.

**Future Enhancements:**
